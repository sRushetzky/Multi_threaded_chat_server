A multi-participant chat system based on Sockets in Python using TCP communication. The system implements parallel bidirectional communication between clients, both privately and globally, through the server. Each client has a user interface guiding them through the various chat operations. At the end of the session, when the server is shut down, a text file containing all chat logs is saved.
